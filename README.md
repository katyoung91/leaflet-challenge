Repository for Assignment 15

This Repo contains the files for assignment 15. For this assignment, I only compelteded the required Part 1 which is why the Part 2 Folder is not included. 

In Leaflet-Part-1 You will find this readme, the git ignore and the Leaflet-Part-1 Folder that contains the main code files for this assignment. 

In this folder there is the index.html which loads the leaflet maps. 

In the static folder is the js file containing the code used to make the map and the css file that was used to apply additional formatting to the legend.
